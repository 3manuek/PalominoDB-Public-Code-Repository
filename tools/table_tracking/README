== Overview

Table Tracking Toolkit allows simple collecting and reporting on:
   - Table schema changes (tracking 'show create table' changes over time)
   - Table volume-metrics (tracking table size over time)
TTT has a pluggable system for implementing new metrics which could be used
to track other things like "SHOW STATUS".

TTT also has a pluggable reporting/querying interface which out of the box
support for generating reports suitable for:
  - text viewing ( in the moment troubleshooting, see when it went wrong )
  - email ( being kept apprise of developer madness )
  - nagios ( being alerted of developer madness )

The API docs contain examples, and reference to get you started.

== Installing

If you're reading this, I suspect you already have, but if not:

    $ sudo gem install table-tracking-toolkit-<version>.gem

Is all that is required for installing.

== Configuring

Minimally, what you need is a config.yml, a PDB dsn file,
and somewhere to store the tracked data.
An example of a config.yml, and a dsn.yml are included in the distribution.

It's recommended that you place your configuration somewhere like:
  - /etc/pdb/ttt
  - /usr/local/etc/pdb/ttt

But the toolkit does not enforce any particular location.

== Running

For best results 'ttt-collect' should be run daily or every N hours.
Running it or 'ttt-query' with '--help', or '-h', will show usage information.

In general, though, your 'ttt-collect' commandline will be:
    $ /usr/bin/ttt-collect --config /usr/local/pdb/ttt/config.yml --dsn /usr/local/pdb/dsn.yml

That should be put in a crontab and run as often as you feel like.
