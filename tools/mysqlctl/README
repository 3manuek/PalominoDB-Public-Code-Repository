mysqlctl - A better mysql init script.
--------------------------------------

This script starts and stops mysql in much the same
way as distro-specific init scripts, while also providing
provisions for flushing logs a configurable number of times
before stopping mysql.
It also stops slave before flushing logs so that binary log
corruption doesn't happen as easily.

Usage
------------

If run without options, the script will print
a small usage message detailing how to use it,
and what it's error codes are.

If the tool is invoked as 'mysql.start', 'mysql.stop',
or 'mysql.status', then the corresponding action (start,
stop, status), respectively, is invoked.

It has configurable timeouts for starting and stopping
so that it doesn't hang indefinitely.
The default is 30 seconds, but, that should be bumped
to 900 seconds or more for large installations.


Installation
---------------

The script is location indifferent, so, it can be simply
copied anywhere on the filesystem and it will work.
However, it does *require* that /etc/myctl.cnf be
present, otherwise it will refuse to run.

You can copy the sample myctl.cnf from this distribution
to start one.
The myctl.cnf is a mysql cnf file, so, all of the usual
rules for that apply.
For mysqlctl, there must be two sections present,
client and mysqlctl. These are used for startting, stopping,
and flushing logs, and configuration parameters for the
script itself, respectively.
