checksum-servers.cron - Do a parallel checksum and report back to nagios.

Runs mk-table-checksum on servers and tables specified by a yaml config file.

Dependencies for running are:
  - YAML::Syck
  - Pod::Usage
  - Getopt::Long (should be standard)
  - File::Temp (also standard, I believe)

It should be added a crontab like so:
0 */8 * * * checksum-servers.cron --cfgfile csum-servers.yml

It accepts options:

   --help      Print help.
   --cfgfile   YAML file of tables and IPs, and other configuration.
   --debug     Print status of what it's doing.
   --noop      Don't do anything.


The sample checksum-servers.yml file documents all available options that the YAML file can have.
