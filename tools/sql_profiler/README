== About
This is the new SQLProfiler. It uses mk-query-digest to build detailed reports about slow queries.
It integrates very tightly with TTT-GUI to allow editing comments associated with slow queries, and
to build graphical digrams of slow query origin.

== Installing
The SQLProfiler is more or less runnable from anywhere you would like.
No binary packages exist as of yet, but, after the tool matures they are planned.

SQLProfiler requires an mk-query-digest newer than 12/10/2009, since prior versions have
bugs associated with queries of the form "SHOW CREATE TABLE.." and others.
Both the git repository and any tarball distributes should contain a supported version
of mk-query-digest for use with SQLProfiler.

== Running
For information on using SQLProfiler, simply run sql_profiler.sh with no arguments.

The tarball distribution includes an example configuration to use with SQLProfiler,
and the usage message describes the meaning of all the configuration options.
