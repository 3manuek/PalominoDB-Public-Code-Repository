So uh, this is a rather informal changelog.

From beta3a:
 - Now comes with a fake snapshot plugin! To prevent the raw/logical MADNESS!
 - Buttloads more debugging. I may eventually make ZRM noisy enough. Prolly not.
 - Comes with an example config file for "BackupSet1"

From beta2:
 - Detect FreeBSD and run tar with bsd compatible options.
 - Consolidated some duplicate code for ease of maintenance.

From beta1:
 - Changed version number in the socket-server/copy scripts
   to prevent badness with the originals.
 - Moved the innobackup.log to /var/log/mysql-zrm/
 - Cleaned out some dead code.
