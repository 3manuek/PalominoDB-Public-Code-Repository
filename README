README For the innobackupex ZRM plugin

Installing:
  Place all of the perl scripts in /usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins,
  or to whatever root you have installed zrm in. (So /usr/local/share/mysql-zrm/plugins,
  if your root is /usr/local.)
  The scripts need to be executable, and owned by the zrm user (usually mysql).
  The sample mysql-zrm.conf file provided can be used as a template for config.
  You should also probably place zrm_nsca.cfg in /usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins
  and make it readable by the zrm user, so that socket-server.palomino.pl can
  send status to nagios.

  You must edit socket-server.palomino.pl to point to your real nagios server,
  and the real path to send_nsca, and the real path to a nsca config file readable
  by the zrm user. The next version will have a config file so that these edits
  need not be made on every upgrade.

  /etc/xinetd.d/mysql-zrm-socket-server needs to have this line:
  server = /usr/share/mysql-zrm/plugins/socket-server.palomino.pl

  Included in the tarball is the file example_nagios.cfg, which contains a service
  definition, and a couple command definitions that should work with a stock
  redhat/centos nagios install. It should obviously be modified to suit your environment.

  Be aware that this socket server (by design) will not interoperate with stock zrm
  plugins. The version number was changed to protect you against any badness from
  possible incompatibilities I may have introduced.

Files:
  The scripts MUST have the ability to create files in /tmp.
  Specifically, the directory /tmp/zrm-innosnap, and the file 'running' underneath it.
  That file is used to forward data to the copy plugin after the snapshot has been made.
  Innobackupex also creates a directory under /tmp, that contains state for while it's running.
  It doesn't appear to clean it up, but it also appears to be harmless between runs to leave it.
  The script also creates /tmp/innobackupex-log, which is a fifo for reading the logs from innobackupex
  so that it can alert nagios in the event of failure.

Logs/Troubleshooting:
  - /var/log/socket-server.log
    Contains standard zrm socket server logging plus the innobackupex log.
    It also doesn't truncate after every run. It's also more verbose.
    The line 'createLink' will help you track down mismatches between zrm and innobackupex,
    though, technically, I don't think it matters.
    
How it works:
  This is documented in the scripts also but basically this is what it does:
  1. ZRM starts up, copies away replication info, etc. It also places a config file in /tmp.
  2. ZRM creates a snapshot, and mounts it.
      inno-snapshot.pl grabs the user/name and password from the config file that ZRM placed,
      and squirrels it away in /tmp/zrm-innosnap/running along with a timestamp, that could be
      used for staleness checking, but is currently ignored.
      It does this because ZRM DELETES that config file after making the snapshot under
      the assumption that it can just copy files now and that there won't be any programs
      in between.
  3. ZRM attempts to copy the files
      The socket-server script checks for /tmp/zrm-innosnap/running and if it's present,
      reads the username/password from it, and redirects to innobackupex <- this is the magic part.
      Otherwise it lets the copy proceed as normal. That check allows copying repl files work.
  4. ZRM unmounts and destroys the snapshot.
      inno-snapshot.pl just deletes /tmp/zrm-innnosnap.
  5. ZRM believes that is has raw copied your database. :)
