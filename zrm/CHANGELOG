So uh, this is a rather informal changelog.
From beta6:
 - Config file for socket-server.palomino.pl to support upgrades.

From beta5:
 - inno-snapshot.pl "human sleeps" reduced from 30s to 5s.
 - New dependency on send_nsca for nagios reporting.
 - New config variables:
   - $nsca_client (path to send_nsca, usually /usr/sbin/send_nsca).
   - $nagios_server (hostname of the nagios machine running nsca daemon).
   - $nagios_service (name of the service for backup reporting).
   - $nsca_cfg (path to nsca config file, example provided. MUST be readable by mysql user).
 - Creates a fifo /tmp/innobackupex-log to check for failures during copy
 - No longer creates /var/log/mysql-zrm/innobackupex.log, that log is now
   merged with /var/log/mysql-zrm/socket-server.log.

From beta4:
 - inno-snapshot.pl no longer has any OS specific code.
 - Yanked out Zmanda license, because more than 60% of the code has been changed,
   making this original work, I think. (We should double check this, and if necessary
   I can rewrite further.)

From beta3a:
 - Now comes with a fake snapshot plugin! To prevent the raw/logical MADNESS!
 - Buttloads more debugging. I may eventually make ZRM noisy enough. Prolly not.
 - Comes with an example config file for "BackupSet1"

From beta2:
 - Detect FreeBSD and run tar with bsd compatible options.
 - Consolidated some duplicate code for ease of maintenance.

From beta1:
 - Changed version number in the socket-server/copy scripts
   to prevent badness with the originals.
 - Moved the innobackup.log to /var/log/mysql-zrm/
 - Cleaned out some dead code.
