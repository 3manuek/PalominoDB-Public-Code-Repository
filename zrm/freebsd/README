Building a package for FreeBSD
==============================

Instructions
------------

    # cd /root
    # tar xzvf zrm-innobackupex-0.72.tgz zrm-innobackupex-0.72/freebsd
    # cd zrm-innobackupex-0.72
    # DISTDIR=/root make -f freebsd/Makefile package
    #
    # That will both install and build the package for you,
    # since freebsd has no concept of non-root package builds, afaik.
    # 
    # DISTDIR=/root make -f freebsd/Makefile deinstall
    #
    # Removes the version installed by 'package', since it doesn't do
    # all the good things.
    #
    # pkg_add zrm-innobackupex-0.72.tbz
    #
    # Add the package to the system, if needed.
    # You can now copy the tarball around and install anywhere else you'd like.
