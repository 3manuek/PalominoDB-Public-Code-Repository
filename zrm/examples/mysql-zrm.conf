## Other relevant ZRM options:
## These options are provided by ZRM and their functionality
## with respect to these plugins is described here.
##
## mysql-binlog-path   - Used exactly as the ZRM documents describe.
##                       If set, the agent will copy binlogs from an alternate
##                       directory.
##

##
## Additional options available:
## All these options have a prefix xtrabackup-client or xtrabackup-agent
## For the descriptions, these were dropped. See below for full names.
## In some cases, a client option will set the default for the agent,
## those cases are noted in the descriptions.
##
## tar-force-ownership - Normally tar will try to unpack files as the user
##                       specified by the stream. Setting this to 0 will
##                       disable that behavior. Highly useful for writing
##                       backups to a NetApp (NFS), for instance.
##
## innobackupex-path   - Path to innobackupex on the backup server.
##                       Not usually needed. Only if you can't put it in
##                       your $PATH environment variable for some reason.
##                       This value also sets the default for the agent.
##
## unpack-backup       - Normally (1) the stream from the agent is passed into
##                       tar to allow ZRM to compress the backups.
##                       Setting this to 0 disables that and writes directly
##                       to a compressed backup-data file. Use when you're
##                       low on disk space. See also: inline-compress
##                       When using this option, to unpack full backups, you
##                       MUST use the '-i' option to tar, otherwise you will
##                       be unable to extract your backup.
##
## inline-compress     - Instruct the agent to compress the tar stream before
##                       sending it to the backup server. Use when bandwidth
##                       is less than CPU, or combine with unpack-backups=0.
##
## run-apply-log       - Do the innobackupex --apply-log on the backup server.
##                       This can save time on restores. Incompatible with
##                       unpack-backups=0.
##
## socket              - Specify the path to the mysql socket for the agent.
##                       This is often needed when perl was built against
##                       stock mysql versions, or when there are multiple
##                       instances of mysql on one machine.
##                       Used to be 'mysql_socket' in socket-server.conf.
##
## nagios-host         - Host that nagios runs on. Used so the client can
##                       ping nagios with backup success/failures.
##                       Used to be 'nagios_host' in socket-server.conf.
##
## nagios-service      - Nagios service that the client should ping.
##                       Used to be 'nagios_service' in socket-server.conf.
##
## send_nsca-path      - Path to the send_nsca program.
##                       Used to be 'nsca_client' in socket-server.conf.
##
## send_nsca-config    - Path to the config for the send_nsca program.
##                       Used to be 'nsca_cfg' in socket-server.conf.
##
## my.cnf-path         - Path to the server my.cnf on the database.
##                       Use when it is in a non-standard location
##                       such as when running multiple mysql instances.
##                       Used to be 'my.cnf_path' in socket-server.conf.
##
## mysql-wait-timeout  - Some instances of MySQL have very low wait_timeout
##                       values to disconnect idle clients. The agent needs
##                       to maintain a long open connection, so, if
##                       you're getting errors about "MySQL server has gone
##                       away", this option is for you.
##                       Values less than 3600 are treated as a number of hours
##                       and, above that, it's treated as a number of seconds.
##                       Used to be 'mysql_wait_timeout' in socket-server.conf.
##
## mysql-net-timeout   - This is similar to mysql-wait-timeout above, but sets
##                       The net_read_timeout and net_write_timeout variables
##                       instead. You'd set this for the same reasons as above.
##
##
## mysql-install-path  - innobackupex needs to make use of the mysql client
##                       program, if it's installed but not in your $PATH,
##                       set this option. Setting this for the client sets the
##                       default for the agent as well.
##                       Used to be 'mysql_install_path' in socket-server.conf.
##
## perl-lib-extra      - Comma separated list of directories to add to the perl
##                       library path to find other perl libraries.
##                       This is most commonly used when installing modules
##                       via CPAN.
##                       Used to be 'perl_dbi_path' in socket-server.conf.
##
## must-set-mysql-timeouts - Turns being unable to set mysql timeout variables
##                           into fatal errors instead of ignorable ones.
##                           Defaults to true (1).
##                           Used to be 'must_set_wait_timeout' in
##                           socket-server.conf.

## Advanced options:
## These options do not normally need to be changed.
## The only reason for changing them is to extract very specific
## behavior out of the client and/or agent.
##
## stream-encoding    - Makes the client request that the agent send backup
##                      data encoded in a variety of different ways.
##                      Normally, the agent will uuencode all data, however
##                      this is very slow. Using this you can ask that the
##                      agent base64 encode the data instead.
##                      Possible values: uuencode, base64.
##                      Default: uuencode
##
## stats-db-path      - The agent keeps records of backups for reporting
##                      and monitoring purposes, this option sets the path
##                      to that database. Normally it exists in the same
##                      directory as the log file and that's usually ok.
##                      Default: /var/log/mysql-zrm
##
## stats-history      - How many entries to keep in the database.
##                      Tune this if you want to keep longer history.
##                      The default is 1000 fulls and incrementals.
##
## innobackupex-opts  - Custom options to be passed *verbatim* to
##                      the innobackupex process when the agent runs.
##                      This should NOT normally be needed, since there
##                      are already specific options for most usecases.
##                      Used to be 'innobackupex_opts' in socket-server.conf.
##
## stream-block-size  - How much data (in bytes) to read/write in a single go.
##                      The default has been selected as a nice balance
##                      between network utilization and CPU time.
##                      Default: 10240
##
##

# xtrabackup-agent:stats-db-path = /var/log/mysql-zrm/stats.db
# xtrabackup-agent:stats-history = 1000
# xtrabackup-agent:innobackupex-opts = --foo
# xtrabackup-client:stream-encoding = base64
# xtrabackup-client:stream-block-size = 16777216

##
## Debugging/development options:
## These options are intended for detailed debugging of the code
## and are left undocumented beyond listing them for that reason.

# xtrabackup-agent:clean-tmpdir=1
# xtrabackup-client:clean-tmpdir=1
