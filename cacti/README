Please, please, please:
Run: `make' BEFORE attempting to send any of these files to a client.

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO USE ANY SCRIPTS OUT OF scripts/, ONLY FILES IN dist/
SHOULD BE USED.

If you do not have a dist/ directory, then you didn't run `make'. :)

The makefile in this directory does IMPORTANT pre-processing on the
scripts to get them ready for use. Things like:
  Applying patches
  Building templates
  Running tests

When make is done, it will have placed the production-ready scripts
in dist/.
